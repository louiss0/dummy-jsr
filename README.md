<!--
   I decided to only have the following sections.
   JSR creates docs and has a way of making the user click to install a file.
   There is no need to do that. 
   Go to https://jsdoc.app for docs. 
  
   The most important tags to remember are 
   
   - @example 
   - @link / @tutorial
   - @deprecated
   - @returns
   - @param
   - @throws
   - @callback
   - @summary
   - @description
